## Dart Best Practices
* **Effective Dart:** Follow the official Effective Dart guidelines
  (https://dart.dev/effective-dart)
* **Class Organization:** Define related classes within the same library file.
* **API Documentation:** Add documentation comments to all public APIs,
  including classes, constructors, methods, and top-level functions.
* **Comments:** Write clear comments for complex or non-obvious code. Avoid
  over-commenting.
* **Trailing Comments:** Don't add trailing comments.
* **Null Safety:** Write code that is soundly null-safe. Leverage Dart's null
  safety features. Avoid `!` unless the value is guaranteed to be non-null.
* **Pattern Matching:** Use pattern matching features where they simplify the
  code.
* **Records:** Use records to return multiple types in situations where defining
  an entire class is cumbersome.
* **Switch Statements:** Prefer using exhaustive `switch` statements or
  expressions, which don't require `break` statements.
* **Arrow Functions:** Use arrow syntax for simple one-line functions.

## Flutter Best Practices
* **Immutability:** Widgets (especially `StatelessWidget`) are immutable; when
  the UI needs to change, Flutter rebuilds the widget tree.
* **Private Methods:** Use small, private methods that return a `Widget` instead of private
  classes.
* **Build Methods:** Break down large `build()` methods into smaller, reusable
  private methods that return a `Widget`.
* **List Performance:** Use `ListView.builder` or `SliverList` for long lists to
  create lazy-loaded lists for performance.
* **Const Constructors:** Use `const` constructors for widgets and in `build()`
  methods whenever possible to reduce rebuilds.
* **Build Method Performance:** Avoid performing expensive operations, like
  network calls or complex computations, directly within `build()` methods.

## Layout Best Practices

### Building Flexible and Overflow-Safe Layouts

#### For Rows and Columns

* **`Expanded`:** Use to make a child widget fill the remaining available space
  along the main axis.
* **`Flexible`:** Use when you want a widget to shrink to fit, but not
  necessarily grow. Don't combine `Flexible` and `Expanded` in the same `Row` or
  `Column`.
* **`Wrap`:** Use when you have a series of widgets that would overflow a `Row`
  or `Column`, and you want them to move to the next line.

#### For General Content

* **`SingleChildScrollView`:** Use when your content is intrinsically larger
  than the viewport, but is a fixed size.
* **`ListView` / `GridView`:** For long lists or grids of content, always use a
  builder constructor (`.builder`).
* **`FittedBox`:** Use to scale or fit a single child widget within its parent.
* **`LayoutBuilder`:** Use for complex, responsive layouts to make decisions
  based on the available space.

### Layering Widgets with Stack

* **`Positioned`:** Use to precisely place a child within a `Stack` by anchoring it to the edges.
* **`Align`:** Use to position a child within a `Stack` using alignments like `Alignment.center`.

### Advanced Layout with Overlays

* **`OverlayPortal`:** Use this widget to show UI elements (like custom
  dropdowns or tooltips) "on top" of everything else. It manages the
  `OverlayEntry` for you.

  ```dart
  class MyDropdown extends StatefulWidget {
    const MyDropdown({super.key});

    @override
    State<MyDropdown> createState() => _MyDropdownState();
  }

  class _MyDropdownState extends State<MyDropdown> {
    final _controller = OverlayPortalController();

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return OverlayPortal(
        controller: _controller,
        overlayChildBuilder: (BuildContext context) {
          return const Positioned(
            top: 50,
            left: 10,
            child: Card(
              child: Padding(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: Text('I am an overlay!'),
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _controller.toggle,
          child: const Text('Toggle Overlay'),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

## Documentation

* **`dartdoc`:** Write `dartdoc`-style comments for all public APIs.

### Documentation Philosophy

* **Comment wisely:** Use comments to explain why the code is written a certain
  way, not what the code does. The code itself should be self-explanatory.
* **Document for the user:** Write documentation with the reader in mind. If you
  had a question and found the answer, add it to the documentation where you
  first looked. This ensures the documentation answers real-world questions.
* **No useless documentation:** If the documentation only restates the obvious
  from the code's name, it's not helpful. Good documentation provides context
  and explains what isn't immediately apparent.
* **Consistency is key:** Use consistent terminology throughout your
  documentation.

### Commenting Style

* **Use `///` for doc comments:** This allows documentation generation tools to
  pick them up.
* **Start with a single-sentence summary:** The first sentence should be a
  concise, user-centric summary ending with a period.
* **Separate the summary:** Add a blank line after the first sentence to create
  a separate paragraph. This helps tools create better summaries.
* **Avoid redundancy:** Don't repeat information that's obvious from the code's
  context, like the class name or signature.
* **Don't document both getter and setter:** For properties with both, only
  document one. The documentation tool will treat them as a single field.

### Writing Style

* **Be brief:** Write concisely.
* **Avoid jargon and acronyms:** Don't use abbreviations unless they are widely
  understood.
* **Use Markdown sparingly:** Avoid excessive markdown and never use HTML for
  formatting.
* **Use backticks for code:** Enclose code blocks in backtick fences, and
  specify the language.

## Effective Dart Rules

### Naming Conventions
1. Use terms consistently throughout your code.
2. Follow existing mnemonic conventions when naming type parameters (e.g., `E` for element, `K`/`V` for key/value, `T`/`S`/`U` for generic types).
3. Name types using `UpperCamelCase` (classes, enums, typedefs, type parameters).
4. Name extensions using `UpperCamelCase`.
5. Name packages, directories, and source files using `lowercase_with_underscores`.
6. Name import prefixes using `lowercase_with_underscores`.
7. Name other identifiers using `lowerCamelCase` (variables, parameters, named parameters).
8. Capitalize acronyms and abbreviations longer than two letters like words.
9. Avoid abbreviations unless the abbreviation is more common than the unabbreviated term.
10. Prefer putting the most descriptive noun last in names.
11. Consider making code read like a sentence when designing APIs.
12. Prefer a noun phrase for non-boolean properties or variables.
13. Prefer a non-imperative verb phrase for boolean properties or variables.
14. Prefer the positive form for boolean property and variable names.
15. Consider omitting the verb for named boolean parameters.
16. Use camelCase for variable and function names.
17. Use PascalCase for class names.
18. Use snake_case for file names.

### Types and Functions
1. Use class modifiers to control if your class can be extended or used as an interface.
2. Type annotate variables without initializers.
3. Type annotate fields and top-level variables if the type isn't obvious.
4. Annotate return types on function declarations.
5. Annotate parameter types on function declarations.
6. Write type arguments on generic invocations that aren't inferred.
7. Annotate with `dynamic` instead of letting inference fail.
8. Use `Future<void>` as the return type of asynchronous members that do not produce values.
9. Use getters for operations that conceptually access properties.
10. Use setters for operations that conceptually change properties.
11. Use a function declaration to bind a function to a name.
12. Use inclusive start and exclusive end parameters to accept a range.

### Style
1. Use curly braces for all flow control statements.
2. Prefer `final` over `var` when variable values won't change.
3. Use `const` for compile-time constants.
4. Prefer lines 100 characters or fewer for readability.

### Structure
1. Keep files focused on a single responsibility.
2. Limit file length to maintain readability.
3. Prefer making fields and top-level variables `final`.
4. Consider making your constructor `const` if the class supports it.
5. Prefer making declarations private.


### Documentation
1. Format comments like sentences.
2. Use `///` doc comments to document members and types; don't use block comments for documentation.
3. Prefer writing doc comments for public APIs.
4. Consider writing doc comments for private APIs.
5. Consider including explanations of terminology, links, and references in library-level docs.
6. Start doc comments with a single-sentence summary.
7. Separate the first sentence of a doc comment into its own paragraph.
8. Avoid redundancy with the surrounding context.
9. Prefer starting comments of a function or method with third-person verbs if its main purpose is a side effect.
10. Prefer a noun phrase or non-imperative verb phrase for a function or method if returning a value is its primary purpose.
11. Prefer starting non-boolean variable or property comments with a noun phrase.
12. Prefer starting boolean variable or property comments with "Whether" followed by a noun or gerund phrase.
13. Prefer starting library or type comments with noun phrases.
14. Use square brackets in doc comments to refer to in-scope identifiers.
15. Use prose to explain parameters, return values, and exceptions.
	- Consider using short sections such as "The [parameter]", "Returns", and "Throws" to make parameter and error documentation clearer.
16. Put doc comments before metadata annotations.
17. Document why code exists or how it should be used, not just what it does.

### Testing
1. Write unit tests for business logic.
2. Write golden tests for UI pages, popups, components.
3. Aim for good test coverage.

### Widgets
1. Extract reusable widgets into separate components.
2. Use `StatelessWidget` when possible.
3. Keep build methods simple and focused.

### Performance
1. Use `const` constructors when possible.
2. Avoid expensive operations in build methods.

## Dart 3 Updates

### Branches
1. Use `if` statements for conditional branching. The condition must evaluate to a boolean.
2. `if` statements support optional `else` and `else if` clauses for multiple branches.
3. Use `if-case` statements to match and destructure a value against a single pattern. Example: `if (pair case [int x, int y]) { ... }`
4. If the pattern in an `if-case` matches, variables defined in the pattern are in scope for that branch.
5. If the pattern does not match in an `if-case`, control flows to the `else` branch if present.
6. Use `switch` statements to match a value against multiple patterns (cases). Each `case` can use any kind of pattern.
7. When a value matches a `case` pattern in a `switch` statement, the case body executes and control jumps to the end of the switch. `break` is not required.
8. You can end a non-empty `case` clause with `continue`, `throw`, or `return`.
9. Use `default` or `_` in a `switch` statement to handle unmatched values.
10. Empty `case` clauses fall through to the next case. Use `break` to prevent fallthrough.
11. Use `continue` with a label for non-sequential fallthrough between cases.
12. Use logical-or patterns (e.g., `case a || b`) to share a body or guard between cases.
13. Use `switch` expressions to produce a value based on matching cases. Syntax differs from statements: omit `case`, use `=>` for bodies, and separate cases with commas.
14. In `switch` expressions, the default case must use `_` (not `default`).
15. Dart checks for exhaustiveness in `switch` statements and expressions, reporting a compile-time error if not all possible values are handled.
16. To ensure exhaustiveness, use a default (`default` or `_`) case, or switch over enums or sealed types.
17. Use the `sealed` modifier on a class to enable exhaustiveness checking when switching over its subtypes.
18. Add a guard clause to a `case` using `when` to further constrain when a case matches. Example: `case pattern when condition:`
19. Guard clauses can be used in `if-case`, `switch` statements, and `switch` expressions. The guard is evaluated after pattern matching.
20. If a guard clause evaluates to false, execution proceeds to the next case (does not exit the switch).

### Patterns
1. Patterns are a syntactic category that represent the shape of values for matching and destructuring.
2. Pattern matching checks if a value has a certain shape, constant, equality, or type.
3. Pattern destructuring allows extracting parts of a matched value and binding them to variables.
4. Patterns can be nested, using subpatterns (outer/inner patterns) for recursive matching and destructuring.
5. Use wildcard patterns (`_`) to ignore parts of a matched value; use rest elements in list patterns to ignore remaining elements.
6. Patterns can be used in:
   - Local variable declarations and assignments
   - For and for-in loops
   - If-case and switch-case statements
   - Control flow in collection literals
7. Pattern variable declarations start with `var` or `final` and bind new variables from the matched value. Example: `var (a, [b, c]) = ('str', [1, 2]);`
8. Pattern variable assignments destructure a value and assign to existing variables. Example: `(b, a) = (a, b); // swap values`
9. Every case clause in `switch` and `if-case` contains a pattern. Any kind of pattern can be used in a case.
10. Case patterns are refutable; if the pattern doesn't match, execution continues to the next case.
11. Destructured values in a case become local variables scoped to the case body.
12. Use logical-or patterns (e.g., `case a || b`) to match multiple alternatives in a single case.
13. Use logical-or patterns with guards (`when`) to share a body or guard between cases.
14. Guard clauses (`when`) evaluate a condition after matching; if false, execution proceeds to the next case.
15. Patterns can be used in for and for-in loops to destructure collection elements (e.g., destructuring `MapEntry` in map iteration).
16. Object patterns match named object types and destructure their data using getters. Example: `var Foo(:one, :two) = myFoo;`
17. Use patterns to destructure records, including positional and named fields, directly into local variables.
18. Patterns enable algebraic data type style code: use sealed classes and switch on subtypes for exhaustive matching.
19. Patterns simplify validation and destructuring of complex data structures, such as JSON, in a declarative way. Example: `if (data case {'user': [String name, int age]}) { ... }`
20. Patterns provide a concise alternative to verbose type-checking and destructuring code.

### Pattern Types
1. Pattern precedence determines evaluation order; use parentheses to group lower-precedence patterns.
2. Logical-or patterns (`pattern1 || pattern2`) match if any branch matches, evaluated left-to-right. All branches must bind the same set of variables.
3. Logical-and patterns (`pattern1 && pattern2`) match if both subpatterns match. Bound variable names must not overlap between subpatterns.
4. Relational patterns (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) match if the value compares as specified to a constant. Useful for numeric ranges and can be combined with logical-and.
5. Cast patterns (`subpattern as Type`) assert and cast a value to a type before passing it to a subpattern. Throws if the value is not of the type.
6. Null-check patterns (`subpattern?`) match if the value is not null, then match the inner pattern. Binds the non-nullable type. Use constant pattern `null` to match null.
7. Null-assert patterns (`subpattern!`) match if the value is not null, else throw. Use in variable declarations to eliminate nulls. Use constant pattern `null` to match null.
8. Constant patterns match if the value is equal to a constant (number, string, bool, named constant, const constructor, const collection, etc.). Use parentheses and `const` for complex expressions.
9. Variable patterns (`var name`, `final Type name`) bind new variables to matched/destructured values. Typed variable patterns only match if the value has the declared type.
10. Identifier patterns (`foo`, `_`) act as variable or constant patterns depending on context. `_` always acts as a wildcard and matches/discards any value.
11. Parenthesized patterns (`(subpattern)`) control pattern precedence and grouping, similar to expressions.
12. List patterns (`[subpattern1, subpattern2]`) match lists and destructure elements by position. The pattern length must match the list unless a rest element is used.
13. Rest elements (`...`, `...rest`) in list patterns match arbitrary-length lists or collect unmatched elements into a new list.
14. Map patterns (`{"key": subpattern}`) match maps and destructure by key. Only specified keys are matched; missing keys throw a `StateError`.
15. Record patterns (`(subpattern1, subpattern2)`, `(x: subpattern1, y: subpattern2)`) match records by shape and destructure positional/named fields. Field names can be omitted if inferred from variable or identifier patterns.
16. Object patterns (`ClassName(field1: subpattern1, field2: subpattern2)`) match objects by type and destructure using getters. Extra fields in the object are ignored.
17. Wildcard patterns (`_`, `Type _`) match any value without binding. Useful for ignoring values or type-checking without binding.
18. All pattern types can be nested and combined for expressive and precise matching and destructuring.

### Records
1. Records are anonymous, immutable, aggregate types that bundle multiple objects into a single value.
2. Records are fixed-sized, heterogeneous, and strongly typed. Each field can have a different type.
3. Records are real values: store them in variables, nest them, pass to/from functions, and use in lists, maps, and sets.
4. Record expressions use parentheses with comma-delimited positional and/or named fields, e.g. `('first', a: 2, b: true, 'last')`.
5. Record type annotations use parentheses with comma-delimited types. Named fields use curly braces: `({int a, bool b})`.
6. The names of named fields are part of the record's type (shape). Records with different named field names have different types.
7. Positional field names in type annotations are for documentation only and do not affect the record's type.
8. Record fields are accessed via built-in getters: positional fields as `$1`, `$2`, etc., and named fields by their name (e.g., `.a`).
9. Records are immutable: fields do not have setters.
10. Records are structurally typed: the set, types, and names of fields define the record's type (shape).
11. Two records are equal if they have the same shape and all corresponding field values are equal. Named field order does not affect equality.
12. Records automatically define `hashCode` and `==` based on structure and field values.
13. Use records for functions that return multiple values; destructure with pattern matching: `var (name, age) = userInfo(json);`
14. Destructure named fields with the colon syntax: `final (:name, :age) = userInfo(json);`
15. Using records for multiple returns is more concise and type-safe than using classes, lists, or maps.
16. Use lists of records for simple data tuples with the same shape.
17. Use type aliases (`typedef`) for record types to improve readability and maintainability.
18. Changing a record type alias does not guarantee all code using it is still type-safe; only classes provide full abstraction/encapsulation.
19. Extension types can wrap records but do not provide full abstraction or protection.
20. Records are best for simple, immutable data aggregation; use classes for abstraction, encapsulation, and behavior.
