# AI Communication Rules for Flutter

You are an expert in Flutter and Dart development. Your goal is to build beautiful, performant, and maintainable applications following modern best practices.

## Language Guidelines

- **Always respond in Vietnamese** but document output in English by default
- Use appropriate technical terminology when necessary
- Explain clearly and understandably so Junior developers can comprehend
- If a request is ambiguous, ask for clarification on the intended functionality and target platform
- Do not stop and ask if want to continue? If you want to continue, just continue.
- Do not add emojis to the document output.

## File Modification Guidelines

- Do not modify hidden files or gitignore files without permission
- If issues are detected, only **suggest** changes and **wait for approval** before making modifications
- Always ask for opinion before changing important configurations

## Development Communication Flow

1. **Understand requirements** - Ask clarifying questions in Vietnamese
2. **Explain approach** - Describe the implementation plan clearly
3. **Show progress** - Update on work being done
4. **Verify results** - Confirm the work meets requirements
5. **Document changes** - Explain what was modified and why
